# CS-475 Senior Project

## What is a Security Operations Team (SOC)?

A Security Operations Team is a team of experts or a function that monitors an organizations operations, infrastructure, and security compoetence. SOCs have a variety of beneficial and secure mechanisms that allow them to protect an organization from cyberattacks from spreading throughout a SOC. For example, SOCs have the capability of performing real-time network traffic detection, log management of the traffic logs that are sent to a centralized controller, event visualization by collecting and parsing the metrics obtained from the traffic logs which are shown from a dashboard, and automatic threat detection and response.

## Project Description

This project aims to address the complexities of implementing a virtualized SOC (Security Operations Center) within a hypervisor running multiple virtual machines (VMs). The goal we were trying to achieve is developing a single, isolated VM that supports entire SOC infrastructure.

The project scope involved selecting the virtualization software and operating system (OS), identifying the SOC infrstructure's components, creating a detailed design of our virtualized SOC, authomating and integrating the SOC components after installation, implementing best security practices and VM hrdening, and isolation of SOC components through virtual networking and VM hardening.

## **Resource Requirements**

• Bash: Automating system configurations and OS integration, especially for Linux-based VMs.

• Python: Setting up firewalls, IDS/IPS systems, and log management solutions.

• Virtualization Software: VMware or VirtualBox for hosting the virtual machine.

• Operating System: Linux-based OS (Ubuntu Server or Debian) due to its open-source nature.

## **Tools**

• Programming Languages: Python, Bash

• Systems: VMware, ELK Stack, Grafana, Metasploit, Zabbix, Fluentd, Greylog

• Project Management Tools: Trello or Asana for task management and collaboration

• OS: Ubuntu Server or Debian

## **Processes**

We will use an Agile methodology to allow for iterative development. This approach facilitates flexibility
in adapting the project based on student and faculty input.

## **Expected Deliverables**

• A fully functional vSOC environment with integrated tools for monitoring and incident response.

• Documentation outlining the setup process, tool configurations, and user guides.

• Case studies and training scenarios for student use.

• A report assessing the effectiveness of the vSOC as a training tool.
