# CS475_Senior_Project

This project aims to address the complexities of implementing a virtualized SOC (Security Operations Center) within a hypervisor running multiple virtual machines (VMs). The goal we were trying to achieve is developing a single, isolated VM that supports entire SOC infrastructure.

The project scope involved selecting the virtualization software and operating system (OS), identifying the SOC infrstructure's components, creating a detailed design of our virtualized SOC, authomating and integrating the SOC components after installation, implementing best security practices and VM hrdening, and isolation of SOC components through virtual networking and VM hardening.
