## What is a Security Operations Team (SOC)?

A Security Operations Team is a team of experts or a function that monitors an organizations operations, infrastructure, and security compoetence. SOCs have a variety of beneficial and secure mechanisms that allow them to protect an organization from cyberattacks from spreading throughout a SOC.

## Project Description

This project aims to address the complexities of implementing a virtualized SOC (Security Operations Center) within a hypervisor running multiple virtual machines (VMs). The goal we were trying to achieve is developing a single, isolated VM that supports entire SOC infrastructure.

The project scope involved selecting the virtualization software and operating system (OS), identifying the SOC infrstructure's components, creating a detailed design of our virtualized SOC, authomating and integrating the SOC components after installation, implementing best security practices and VM hrdening, and isolation of SOC components through virtual networking and VM hardening.
