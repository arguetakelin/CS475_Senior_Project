# CS475_Senior_Project

This project will focus on the complexities of implementing a virtualized SOC (Security Operations Center). The goal we were trying to achieve is a single solated VM that consists of the entire SOC infrastructure. We selected the virtualization software and operating system (OS). Next, we will determine our SOC infrastructureâ€™s requirements e.g. firewall, log management application, etc. We will design the SOC infrastructure and create a detailed plan for the configuration of the components and their potential interaction. We will set up the VM and allocate a dedicated amount of resources, run the operating system on the VM, and use a scripting language to install the SOC components. We will need to utilize scripting to automate the SOC component processes to ensure a secure VM environment, implement the best security practices, and harden the VM environment by creating an isolated virtual network or implementing an existing firewall.
